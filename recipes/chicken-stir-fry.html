    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat.<br>
        Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. </li>

        <li>Combine soy sauce, brown sugar, and corn starch in a small bowl; stir until smooth.<br>
        Mix ginger, garlic, and red pepper into sauce; coat chicken with marinade and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.</li>

        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. <br> Cook and stir bell pepper, water chestnuts, broccoli, carrots, and onion until just tender, about 5 minutes. Remove vegetables from skillet and keep warm.</li>

        <li>Remove chicken from marinade, reserving liquid. Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in skillet over medium-high heat.<br>
        Cook and stir chicken until slightly pink on the inside, about 2 minutes per side; return vegetables and reserved marinade to skillet.<br>
        Bring to a boil; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the middle and vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve over rice.</li>
